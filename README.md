## 📝 Problem Statement  
The company’s HR department faced difficulty understanding workforce trends, compensation patterns, and employee demographics. Without a structured view, identifying salary gaps, age distribution, and role-based income differences was challenging, making workforce planning and retention strategies less effective.

---

## ✅ Solution  
Built an Employee Analytics Dashboard in Power BI that provides an interactive view of employee data. The dashboard consolidates key metrics such as employee count, average salary, average age, and hourly rate, with drill-down filters by department and gender for detailed analysis.

## 🔎 Approach  
- **Data Preparation & Transformation:** Cleaned and structured the Excel dataset, promoted headers, set proper data types, and created a calculated column for attrition.  
- **Dashboard Development:**  
  - **KPIs:** Employee count, average hourly rate, average age, and salary.  
  - **Visuals:**  
    - Stacked column chart – salary hikes by salary slab  
    - Stacked column chart – average age by business travel  
    - Pie chart – monthly income by department  
    - Funnel chart – monthly income by job role  
  - **Filters:** Department and Gender for drill-down analysis

## 📈 Key Insights  
1. Employees in lower salary slabs (<₹5k) received slightly higher hikes (~15.3%) compared to higher slabs, with Sales staff earning the highest average income.  
2. Minor gender differences were observed, with females earning slightly more than males in HR (7.26k vs 6.37k) and R&D (6.51k vs 6.13k); salaries in Sales were nearly equal.  
3. Younger employees (<30) traveled more frequently, and income gaps across roles were significant, with Managers earning nearly 6x more than Sales Representatives, indicating potential attrition risks.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations  
1. Monitor lower salary slab employees (<₹5k) and address pay gaps across departments and roles to ensure fair compensation and reduce attrition risk.  
2. Provide training, mentorship, and well-being programs, especially for younger employees with frequent travel, to support career progression and prevent burnout.
